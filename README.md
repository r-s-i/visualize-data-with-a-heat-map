# Global Land-Surface Temperature Per Month

This is my answer to freeCodeCamp's Visualize Data with a Heat Map project. It shows data from 1753 to 2015. It has a base temperature of 8.66 â„ƒ. With hovering over the rects, a tooltip with details will appear. One can also tap the rects on a touch device.

## Getting Started

Simply run the code by opening the index.html file in a web browser. [Or go to where I host it](https://robiniversen.com/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map/).

## Data Source

The data is fetched from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json. As far as I can tell, no original source for the data was given, but I am assuming that it was obtained from Berkeley Earth.
